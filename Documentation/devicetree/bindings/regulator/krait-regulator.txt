Krait Voltage regulators

The cpus are powered using a single supply powered by PMIC ganged regulators operating in
different phases. Individual kraits further can draw power from the single supply via
a LDO or a head switch (BHS).  The first level node represents the PMIC ganged regulator
and its properties and encompasses second level nodes that represent the individual
krait LDO/BHS control regulator.

[First Level Nodes]
Required properties:
- compatible:			Must be "qcom,krait-pdn"
- reg:				Specifies the physical address of the APCS GCC
				register base
- reg-names:			"apcs_gcc" -string to identify the area where
				the APCS GCC registers reside.
- qcom,pfm-threshold		The power coeff threshold in abstract power units below which
				pmic will be made to operate in PFM mode.

Optional properties:
- qcom,use-phase-switching	indicates whether the driver should add/shed phases on the PMIC
				ganged regulator as cpus are hotplugged.

[Second Level Nodes]
Required properties:
- compatible:			Must be "qcom,krait-regulator"
- reg:				Specifies the address and size for this regulator device,
				also specifies the address and the size for the MDD area
				to be used along with the regulator
- reg-names:			"acs" -string to identify the area where main power control
					registers reside.
				"mdd" - string to identify the area where mdd registers reside.
- qcom,headroom-voltage:	The minimum required voltage drop between the input
			 	voltage and the output voltage for the LDO to be
			 	operational, in microvolts. Acceptable values are from
				50000uV to 250000uV
- qcom,retention-voltage:	The value for retention voltage in microvolts. Acceptable
				values are from 465000uV to 750000uV
- qcom,ldo-default-voltage:	The default value for LDO voltage in microvolts. Acceptable
				values are from 465000uV to 750000uV
- qcom,ldo-threshold-voltage:	The voltage value above which LDO is nonfunctional.
				Acceptable values are from 600000uV to 900000uV
- qcom,ldo-delta-voltage:	The delta used to reduce the requested voltage in order
				to derive the LDO output voltage while switching
				to LDO mode. Acceptable values are from 1000uV to 100000uV
- qcom,cpu-num:			Indicates what cpu this regulator controls

Any property defined as part of the core regulator
binding, defined in regulator.txt, can also be used.

Example:
	krait_pdn: krait-pdn@f9011000 {
		reg = <0xf9011000 0x1000>;
		reg-names = "apcs_gcc";
		compatible = "qcom,krait-pdn";
		qcom,use-phase-switching;
		qcom,pfm-threshold = <376975>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
		ranges;

		krait0_vreg: regulator@f9088000 {
			compatible = "qcom,krait-regulator";
			regulator-name = "krait0";
			reg = <0xf9088000 0x1000>, /* APCS_ALIAS0_KPSS_ACS */
				<0xf908a800 0x1000>; /* APCS_ALIAS0_KPSS_MDD */
			reg-names = "acs", "mdd";
			regulator-min-microvolt = <500000>;
			regulator-max-microvolt = <1100000>;
			qcom,headroom-voltage = <150000>;
			qcom,retention-voltage = <675000>;
			qcom,ldo-default-voltage = <750000>;
			qcom,ldo-threshold-voltage = <850000>;
			qcom,ldo-delta-voltage = <50000>;
			qcom,cpu-num = <0>;
		};
